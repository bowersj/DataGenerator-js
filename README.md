# Data Generator
Generate sample data with ease and efficiency.

## Purpose

Ever need complex real world like data that even invloves content and other types?

I have, and that is why this library exists. Now in all fairness this library wont be the fastest out there becasue, well, it is written in javascript and uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as its enviroment. But it will easy to use, take advantage of fast and multithreaded enviroments through using the cluster module, more on that latter. So, how does it work? What do I need to do to make this thing generate some data?
